# qsetup
This repo contains my personal .dotfiles and quick-setup scripts made to quickly get my machine up and running after a fresh install. Currently, it:
- sets up dotfiles like .bash_profile and .gitconfig
- installs utilities that don't come natively with macOS, e.g. `wget` and `git-lfs`
- automates installations of a bunch of graphical apps via `brew cask` and `mas-cli`, e.g. VSCode and Xcode

## To-do
- [ ] Update git version with the one from `brew`
- [ ] Install Bash 4 with autocomplete
- [ ] Look into using Brewfiles
- [ ] Improve formatting + directory structure
