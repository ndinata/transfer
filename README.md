# qsetup
This repo contains my personal .dotfiles and shell scripts made to quickly get my machine up and running after a fresh install. Currently, the setup script:
- sets up dotfiles like .bash_profile and .gitconfig;
- installs utilities that don't come natively with macOS, e.g. `wget` and `git-lfs`; and
- automates installations of a bunch of graphical apps via `brew cask` and `mas-cli`, e.g. VSCode and Slack

## To-do
- [ ] Install fonts through brew
- [ ] Add summary at the end of setup
